# Li-Fi-setup-proof

Aim of the project is to set up a proof concept of Li-Fi.

# Advantage of Li-Fi
1    Speed: LiFi provides speeds around 100 times faster than currently achievable speeds in WiFi. Faster communication would result in better service quality and better communication.

2    Efficiency: LiFi is much more efficient when it comes to cost and power consumption. Since it makes use of LED bulbs for communication, these bulbs can double up as regular lighting for a household reducing power consumption of a LiFi network and making it far efficient than existing technologies alongside not requiring any additional hardware for implementation would reduce the cost of setting up LiFi.

3    Availability: Due to the use of LED bulbs, LiFi can be made available everywhere by replacing traditional LED bulbs with LiFi compatible bulbs.

4    Security: Since LiFi makes use of visible light spectrum, it cannot penetrate through optically opaque objects like walls making it difficult for unauthorised access unlike present WiFi which could be accessed from beyond walls and making it vulnerable to unauthorised access.

# Disadvantages of LiFi:

1    Internet cannot be used without a light source.

2    A whole new infrastructure for Li-Fi would need to be constructed.
